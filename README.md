a game I made

Left and right and down to move, Z and X to rotate, and...I think it was space that sets a piece in place?
Three in a row, orthogonally or diagonally, clears tiles and makes tiles above fall.
Play for long enough and something may go wrong, I'm not entirely sure how to fix that but it works for a while.
